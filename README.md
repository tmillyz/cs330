How do I approach designing software?
My approach is to determine and map out the program first before starting any code. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This class has helped me to understand how OpenGL works.  I have learned how to add textures to files as well as build different lighting options.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I would work on one aspect at a time while following the flow of the class.  First, I tried recreating the scene by creating the shapes.
Then I proceeded to add texture and lighting and making sure that each shape was on the plane the way I intended.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
After taking this class I have a new appreciation for the work that goes into creating games and animation.  Although I have no intention
to pursue that type of career I can use the workflow process in other areas.

How do I approach developing programs?
Creating a pseudocode and design system before doing any programming as well as breaking each program down into smaller more manageable tasks.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used the standard SDLC.

How did iteration factor into your development?
I had to start with one aspect like creating shapes, and then textures, then lighting.  Each time I added a new shape I would then complete the other two tasks for that shape.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I think the tasks became a little harder with each milestone.  By the end of the project I was able to identify where I needed to make changes or where to find errors.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I would like to be a software developer so learning CS theory, programming languages, and other tech would be instrumental in helping me achieve that goal.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I'm now more aware of how to create animation using OpenGL.  Not sure exactly how I would use that in the future but it was very intersting to learn.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
It allowed me to realize how difficult graphics really is and if I didn't know before I know that I couldn't commit to a career developing games, unless they are word based games!
